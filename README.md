# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohamed!

I'm a Self-taught Front-end Developer Who Focuses on Writing Clean, Real-world, and Responsive Code.
I Care About Accessibility, Performance, and Building Interfaces That Are Both Functional and User-friendly.

I'm Also Curious About How Things Work Under the Hood, I Enjoy Learning New Concepts and Understanding the "Why" and "How" Behind the Scenes and Technologies I Use.
